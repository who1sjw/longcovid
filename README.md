Big Data Analysis of Long COVID Symptoms

By incorporating temporal analysis and considering various factors such as demographics, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle variables, this research seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of Long COVID symptom patterns and their progression over time. The integration of clinical and social media data allows for a unique perspective that captures both medical realities and public experiences of the condition.

The use of MapReduce algorithms for symptom co-occurrence analysis and sentiment trend analysis represents an innovative approach to processing large volumes of health-related data. This methodology has the potential to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that may not be apparent through traditional analysis methods, contributing to a more detailed understanding of Long COVID symptomatology.
